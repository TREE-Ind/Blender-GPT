# PyAudio

PyAudio provides Python bindings for PortAudio v19, the cross-platform audio I/O library. With PyAudio, you can easily use Python to play and record audio on a variety of platforms, such as GNU/Linux, Microsoft Windows, and Apple macOS.

PyAudio is distributed under the MIT License.

## Installation

See the INSTALLATION file in the source distribution for details. In summary, install PyAudio using `pip` on most platforms.

### Windows

```sh
python -m pip install pyaudio
```

This installs the precompiled PyAudio library with PortAudio v19 19.7.0 included. The library is compiled with support for Windows MME API, DirectSound, WASAPI, and WDM-KS. It does not include support for ASIO. If you require support for APIs not included, you will need to compile PortAudio and PyAudio.

### macOS

Use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) to install the prerequisite [portaudio](http://portaudio.com) library, then install PyAudio using `pip`:

```sh
brew install portaudio
pip install pyaudio
```

### GNU/Linux

Use the package manager to install PyAudio. For example, on Debian-based systems:

```sh
sudo apt install python3-pyaudio
```

Alternatively, if the latest version of PyAudio is not available, install it using `pip`. Be sure to first install development libraries for `portaudio19` and `python3`.

### Building from source

See the INSTALLATION file.

## Documentation & Usage Examples
